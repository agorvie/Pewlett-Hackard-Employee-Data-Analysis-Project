# SQL-Challenge Project
This is a class project for my Data Analytics BootCamp classes at Washignton University. The project involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks focused on exploring employee data from the 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company. The goal is to design a database schema, import CSV data, and answer various analytical questions using SQL queries.

## Background

As a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (fictional Company), I will work with six CSV files containing historical employee data. The task include creating a database schema, importing data, and performing data analysis to extract valuable insights.

## Tasks:

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

### Data Modeling
Before diving into the data engineering and analysis tasks, I sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on the provided CSV files. This diagram helps visualize the relationships between different entities in the dataset.

### Data Engineering
In this part of the project, I created the necessary table schema to accommodate the data from the provided CSV files by following the below guidelines:

  * Specified appropriate data types for each column.
  * Designated primary keys, ensuring uniqueness.
  * Defined foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
  * Created tables in the correct order to handle foreign key dependencies.
  * Imported the data from the CSV files into their respective SQL tables.


### Data Analysis
The final phase involved extracting insights from the data through SQL queries. I answered several questions related to employee information:
  * Listed employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee.
  * Listed first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
  * Listed managers of departments with department number, name, employee number, last name, and first name.
  * Listed department number for each employee along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department 
    name.
  * Listed first name, last name, and sex of employees with first name "Hercules" and last name starting with "B".
  * Listed employees in the Sales department with their employee number, last name, and first name.
  * Listed employees in the Sales and Development departments with employee number, last name, first name, and 
    department name.
  * Listed frequency counts of employee last names in descending order.

## Conclusion
In completing the SQL-Challenge project, I successfully modeled data, engineered the database, and conducted data analysis showing meaningful insights into the employee data from the 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard (fictional Company) using SQL queries.
